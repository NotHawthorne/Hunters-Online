Biscuits: Just started work for the day, planning on working on fixing the item inspection system today as a small goal and picking from one of the major things to work on over the course of the rest of the day. Candidates:
- equipping items
- combat evaluation
- random item generator tuning
- areas/monsters

Biscuits: Wrapping up today, final improvements:

- equipment (UI, SQL, packet structur)
- combat evaluation (found mismatched enum checks)
- random item generator tuning (they can now spawn with different effects)
- client prettification (thanks Alan <3)

Also, items carry weight in combat, so they can affect your abilities now. :)
